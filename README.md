# Homecooked â€” Share Meals with Your Neighborhood

Homecooked is a web application that makes it easy to share your home-cooked meals with people nearby.

As a chef, you can list meals you plan to prepare on a specific day. Set the number of portions, price per portion, pickup time, and pickup location.

As a customer, you can browse local listings and reserve a portion for pickup.

Users can play both roles: cook on some days, order on others.

Meals are paid for directly to the chef at pickup (cash, mobile transfer, etc.).

To build trust in the community, both chefs and customers can leave reviews after each exchange.
